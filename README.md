These are the slides and code demos from my Mono presentation to the Memphis Java and .NET Users Groups.

The only change I have made is to move the Newtonsoft JSON library into the projects (and clean the projects).  Other than that everything is unchanged.  Let me know if something doesn't work.

The references for the presentation are in the next to last slide.
